Project Overview
This parallax website consists of multiple sections that provide a visually appealing and interactive user experience as the user scrolls through the page. These sections include a header with navigation links, a parallax home section with animated images, an "About Us" section, and a "Products" section showcasing different products.

HTML Structure
The HTML file (index.html) is structured as follows:
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration sets the document type to HTML5.
The page includes a <head> section containing metadata, including character encoding, viewport settings, and the page title.
External styles are linked via the <link> tag with the style.css file.
The website content is organized within the <body> element.
The header section contains a logo and navigation links (<ul>).
The parallax home section (<section class="parallax-home">) includes multiple images that create a parallax effect, as well as a title.
The "About Us" section (<section class="about">) contains images and a description of the company.
The "Products" section (<section class="products">) displays product cards with images and descriptions.
JavaScript is included at the end of the <body> to add interactivity.
CSS Styling
CSS styles are defined in the style.css file.
The CSS file is organized to style various elements, including the header, navigation, parallax images, product cards, buttons, and more.
Styles for scrollbars are customized using ::-webkit-scrollbar selectors.
Classes like .btn and .card define styles for buttons and product cards, respectively.
Media queries are used to ensure the website is responsive on different devices.
JavaScript
JavaScript is used to create interactive effects, particularly for the parallax scrolling.
The script defines event listeners that respond to the user's scroll actions.
Elements with IDs like moon, text, and train are animated based on the user's scroll position.
The progress bar is displayed when the user scrolls down and can be clicked to scroll back to the top of the page.
